20 Oct 2009 - 0.3.4b    added only the simple compression algorithm used in Dark Sector (use zip.bms to extract its files)
18 Oct 2009 - 0.3.4a    substituited the strdup function due to its different behaviour on *nix and enabled the usage of lz2k also on *nix
17 Oct 2009 - 0.3.4     added support for plugins and/or custom functions through the CallDLL command, added the unmeng and unlz2k compressions, added a fake 64bit type of variable (fake because QuickBMS works only with 32bit numbers)
12 Oct 2009 - 0.3.3     implemented all the encryption functions of OpenSSL through its great EVP interface, added some new compression algorithms, added some enhancements like the configuration of the lzss parameters and PutVarChr which auto-reallocate the variables

29 Sep 2009 - 0.3.1     added a check to avoid to use file numbers not opened and added support for other compressions: rlew, lzjb, sfl (block/rle/nulls/bits) and lzma2
28 Sep 2009 - 0.3       added documentation, added xor, rot and charset as parts of the Encryption command, now the input can be both an archive and a folder containing more archives
20 Sep 2009 - 0.2.4a    nothing changed, has been only removed xcompress.h
19 Sep 2009 - 0.2.4     solved a small bug when a compressed file has a size equal to zero, added support for XMemDecompress and some lzw variants, added the idea encryption. released also the script for extracting the files of Need for Speed: Shift
11 Jul 2009 - 0.2.3a    fixed only an error in the rarely used Padding command
06 Jul 2009 - 0.2.3     added support for the bzip2 compression, the line data type and various big speed improvements moreover in the byte-per-byte operations (like getvarchr and putvarchr)
08 Jun 2009 - 0.2.2a    adapted the code for accepting the options when launched in GUI mode
07 Jun 2009 - 0.2.2     added the -L option for placing the list of files in a file, added the -D option for using decimal notation internally, optimized the For command, gained some milliseconds from myitoa, added the experimental commands for implementing recursive functions (Start, Call and EndFunction)
27 May 2009 - 0.2.1     fixed the handling of some numbers (signed integers and shifting are not friends), the letters between ' are now considered numbers (so 'a' is 0x61), now in Get/PutVarChr is possible to specify also the size of the number through an optional parameter and added: LZX, Binary and BaseName types, BytesRead and NotEOF internal variables (they are used in MultiEx), handling of elif and else (very useful), a new optional parameter in FindLoc to avoid to terminate the script if the string is not found, various new String operators, GetArray and PutArray functions which can be used to work on some temporary dynamic arrays (useful in some occasions), QuickBMSver command which allows to specify the minimum version of QuickBMS supported by that script
09 May 2009 - 0.2       tons of speed improvements and memory and code optimizations, added the double console+gui mode (works from command-line if started from the console or with a minimal gui if double-clicked), when the tool asks to overwrite an existent file now is possible to use &quot;a&quot; or &quot;all&quot; for overwriting them automatically, added multiple memory files (MEMORY_FILE, MEMORY_FILE2, MEMORY_FILE3 and so on), added a TEMPORARY_FILE which is nothing else than a file with this name which is saved also in list mode, all numeric variables are saved in hexadecimal, FileXOR and FileROT13 now accepts also a variable as argument, added support for various encryption algorithms (aes, blowfish, des, 3des, rc4 and xtea), added the Print command which allows to show a message at runtime and various other enhancements and fixes other than new BMS examples like the one which acts as base for the games which use the TTARCH format (remember that each game has its own key which must be specified in the script)
03 May 2009 - 0.1.6     added the Append command, some small optimizations in the usage of realloc with the variables and the memory_file, corrected the position offset used in filexor/filerot13 if set to zero
29 Apr 2009 - 0.1.5     added the explode (pkware data compression library), gzip and lzma (included handling of the x86 header and decoder) compressions, the filename of any opened file is saved and can be read from inside the scripts (example: get NAME filename 1), added the Padding command, some small enhancements and bugfixes of the code
27 Apr 2009 - 0.1.4a    solved a bug in the handling of LZO compression, the break command, added the cleaning of the filename to save and the visualization of the source code's line in case of errors
25 Apr 2009 - 0.1.4     this tool is a scripts based files extractor compatible with the <a href="http://wiki.xentax.com/index.php/BMS">BMS</a> language. the idea was born from the need of a simple and fast solution for handling the simple types of archives used by the majority of games without losing time writing a stand-alone tool with tons of C code just for a basic file format
